        <h1> ChatGPTargument </h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>Most people see coding with the aid of ChatGPT (or AI in general) as cheating and the start of artificial
            intelligence replacing the "filthy code monkey" known as the programmer. And well, to be fair, lots (AND I
            DO MEAN LOTS) of people use it to cheat on academic tasks and get projects done quicker, but I think that
            its use is much more limited than some may believe, and we, as programmers, are quite far away from being
            replaced.</p><br>
        <p>First, I want to clearly define programming. Programming is telling a computer what to do through CODE. What
            you're telling the computer can be extremely specific (if you are using stuff like Assembly) or a bit more
            vague (scripting languages in general).</p><br>
        <p>Most often, you can afford to be more vague since there is stuff the computer does in the background when
            executing your instructions that really doesn't concern you. For example, anything concerning memory in
            Javascript. The programmer has no control over it.</p><br>
        <p>The more details are left out, the more "abstractized" a programming language is considered. This goes on
            until we get to scripting languages, the ones that are the closest thing to "telling a computer what you
            want" as close to natural language as possible. Until ChatGPT became a thing.</p><br>
        <p>Ignoring the fact that Github Copilot was a thing well before ChatGPT, ChatGPT was the first AI code
            generator that everyone could use easily. No extension and auth token needed, just type in what you want,
            and you get the code. So simple a rat could do it.</p>
        <p>Unlike all other programming languages, you can be super SUPER vague concerning what you want it to do and
            still get code that runs.</p><br>
        <p>This ease of access led to what I mentioned in the first paragraph. But what those "Most People" forgot is
            that as an AI, ChatGPT is trained on publicly obtained data. The reason it is able to solve any given
            problem (that YOU can give it , at least) is that those problems have already been solved by someone else,
            and code extremely similar to what IT gives you can be found on StackOverflow, but less custom-tailored for
            your program.</p><br>
        <p>The majority of the people I know compare it to a search engine on steroids, and while they are extremely
            right, I do like comparing it to a disassembler. But instead of putting in a high-level fancy scripting
            language and getting the precise instructions in machine code, you put in the "idea" for a program.Then you
            get it broken down into computer code instructions in a programming language of your choosing. Disassembling
            the abstract into reality. That has nothing to do with anything but I just felt like throwing this in here.
        </p><br>
        <p>This brings me to my point. Copy-Pasting from ChatGPT is basically the same as copy-pasting from Stack
            Overflow, but with a bit less work. The only argument against what I'm saying is that copy-pasting from SO
            requires a tad more understanding of the code. While that's a fair point, I imagine there are very few
            people that USE the code from ChatGPT with no understanding of it, 0 idea of how to interact with it. </p>
        <br>
        <p>This breaks if you are doing a homework or something, but that's the same as copying from the smart kid that
            you're friends with.That only is a problem if the tutor doesn't check if you actually know what you turned
            in.</p><br>
        <p>If someone wants to generate a big project using AI, with little to no understanding of how it works, chances
            are that whatever is generated is based on already existing open-source projects, and the person in question
            might as well have taken the code from there.</p><br>
        <p>The main takeaway is that I am too cool to be replaced by AI and that ChatGPT shouldn't really affect us (the
            programmers), at
            least not more than Stack Overflow did. </p><br>
        <p>*I would also like to mention that what I said applies for all AI coding tools, but I only talk about ChatGPT
            since it's the most popular.</p>
